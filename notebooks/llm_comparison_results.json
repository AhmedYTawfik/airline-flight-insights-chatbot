In terms of fleet types, both generations use the B737-900 fleet frequently. When it comes to destinations, IAX, EWX, DEX, ORX, and SFX are the top five stations for both generations based on passenger volume. However, the passenger volumes for each destination differ between the two generations. For instance, EWX has a higher passenger volume for Baby Boomers compared to Millennials.\n\nAs for travel preferences, the context does not provide enough information to make a definitive comparison between Millennials and Baby Boomers. To answer that question, additional data such as average travel distance, preferred classes, and loyalty programs would be necessary.",
