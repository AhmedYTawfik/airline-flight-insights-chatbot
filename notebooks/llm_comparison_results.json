The top 5 destination stations for the Millennial generation have lower passenger volumes compared to those for the Baby Boomer generation. For instance, the top destination for the Millennial generation, IAX, has a passenger volume of 75, while the top destination for the Baby Boomer generation, EWX, has a passenger volume of 269.\n\nAs for the travel behavior, the semantic search results do not provide enough information to make a definitive comparison between Millennials and Baby Boomers. However, we can observe that both generations take flights with similar distances, ranging from 414 to 1754 miles, and the number of legs in their journeys also seems comparable, with 1 to 2 leg(s) per journey. Additionally, the given records show that a mix of both generations can have varying experiences in food quality and flight delays.\n\nMore data is required to make a more precise comparison between Millennials and Baby Boomers in terms of travel behavior.",
