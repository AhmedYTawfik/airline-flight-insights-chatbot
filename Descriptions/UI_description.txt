4. Build a UI (e.g., Streamlit)
    Create a user interface that demonstrates your Graph-RAG system in action.
    Streamlit is recommended for its simplicity. The UI should be functional and
    intuitive, but doesn't need to be complex. Focus on demonstrating the system's
    capabilities.
    The UI should allow a user to:
    a. View the KG-retrieved context
        Display the raw information retrieved from the knowledge graph before it's
        processed by the LLM. Show users what nodes, relationships, and data were
        found. This increases transparency and trust.
    b. View the final LLM answer
        Display the LLM's final response to the user's query. The main output is the
        answer generated using the KG context.
    c. Display:
    - Cypher Queries Executed:
        Show the actual Cypher queries that were run to retrieve
        information. This helps users understand how the system found the
        information. Useful for debugging and transparency.
    - Model Selection Dropdown (to switch between LLMs):
        Allow users to select which LLM to use for generating answers.
        Enables real-time comparison of different models' responses to the
        same query.
    - Retrieval Method Selection (baseline, embeddings, or both):
        Allow users to choose which retrieval method(s) to use. Enables comparison of
        baseline Cypher queries vs. embedding-based retrieval vs. hybrid
        approaches.
