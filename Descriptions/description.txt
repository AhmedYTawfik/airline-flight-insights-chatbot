1. Core Objective

Goal: Build an end-to-end Graph-RAG Travel Assistant using the Neo4j Knowledge Graph (KG) from Milestone 2 as a grounding mechanism for an LLM-based system.


Mechanism: Retrieve relevant nodes, relationships, and reviews from the KG to guide the LLM's final answer, reducing hallucinations and increasing factual accuracy.


2. Input Preprocessing
a. Intent Classification: Classify user intent (e.g., question, recommendation, search) to route the query to the correct retrieval strategy . Use rule-based (keyword) or LLM-based classification.


b. Entity Extraction: Use Named Entity Recognition (NER) to extract theme-specific entities (e.g., flights, airports, passengers) to parameterize Cypher queries .

c. Input Embedding: Convert text input into vector representations for semantic similarity search (only required if implementing embedding-based retrieval) .

3. Graph Retrieval Layer (Two Experiments Required)
Experiment 1 (Baseline):

Use Cypher queries to fetch structured information .

Create a library of at least 10 different Cypher query templates covering various intents and entity combinations .

Experiment 2 (Embeddings):

Implement semantic similarity search using vector embeddings .


Models: Experiment with at least two different embedding models.


Approach: Choose either Node Embeddings (vector for each node) or Features Vector Embeddings (combined properties into one vector) .

4. LLM Layer
a. Context Merging: Combine results from both Cypher queries and embedding-based retrieval into a unified, de-duplicated context .

b. Structured Prompting: Use a prompt structure containing:


Context: The retrieved KG data.


Persona: Define a role (e.g., "You are a flight information assistant").


Task: Clear instructions (e.g., "Answer using only provided information").

c. Model Comparison: Test and compare at least three different LLMs (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, Llama) .

d. Evaluation: Provide both Quantitative (accuracy, response time, cost) and Qualitative (naturalness, relevance, correctness) metrics .

5. User Interface (UI)

Framework: Use Streamlit to create a functional and intuitive interface .

Mandatory Features:

View the raw KG-retrieved context for transparency .

View the final LLM-generated answer .


Optional Features: Display executed Cypher queries, graph visualization snippets, or a model selection dropdown .

6. Airline Theme Considerations

Perspective: The application must be from the airline company’s perspective, not the passengers’ (e.g., gaining insights into poorly rated flights) .


Focus: Routes, delays, passenger satisfaction, and journey analysis across airports and passenger classes .

7. Final Deliverables/Presentation Requirements

System Architecture: Document the design with architecture diagrams .


Retrieval Strategy: Explain Cypher and embedding approaches with example queries .


Comparison Analysis: Present the metrics comparing the three+ tested LLM models.


Analysis of Failures: Include error analysis and remaining system limitations
